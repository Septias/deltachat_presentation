- The Bot can be understood as the **backend** of the X-Store.
- It provides a **CLI** for starting the bot, importing apps and other utlity functions.
- To create your own store bot you only need the **store executable** and a list of applications (wexbdcs).
- It **distributes** the frontend and the apps to the users.
